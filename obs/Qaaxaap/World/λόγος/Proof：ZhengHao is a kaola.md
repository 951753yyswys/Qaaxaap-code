**Definition**:
- We say a persion is a kaola if and only if he or she dosen't have the ability to be a person in Wang Xinchun's rule.

**Assume**
1. ZhengHao is honesty.
2. ZhengHao can handle interpersonal relationships.

**Observation**:
1. ZhengHao said she is repugnance with Collapsarr.
2. ZhengHao knew that I dislike her association with Collapsarr.
3. ZhengHao always has conversation with Collapsarr without changing expression.

From the Observation 1,we know that the value of me in her eyes should be upper than Collapsarr's. ①

From the Observation 2 and ①,we know that ZhengHao should't have too much conversation with Collapsarr in front of me. ②

But we see that this contradicts Observation 3.So,at least one of the assumes is wrong.

- If Assume 1 is wrong,it shows that ZhengHao isn't honesty.But Wang Xinchun said,`诚信是一个人的安身立命之本`,so ZhengHao dosen't have the ability to be a person.That shows that ZhengHao is a kaola.
- If Assume 2 is wrong,it shows that ZhengHao can't handle social relationships correctly.But Wang Xinchun said,`人是其社会关系的总和`,so ZhengHao isn't a person.That shows that ZhengHao is a kaola.

**In conclusion**,ZhengHao is a kaola.
