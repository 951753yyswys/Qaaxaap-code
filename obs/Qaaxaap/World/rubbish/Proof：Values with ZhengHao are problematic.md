**string** q:="ZhengHao".

**string** k:="Collapsarr".

**Assume, for contradiction**, that values with ZhengHao are sound.

**Axiom**:I and q are friends,q and k aren't friends.

**Observation**:

1. Q knows that joking with k will make me deeply uncomfortable,she said it's to take care of his emotions.
2. Q told me that she has a physiological aversion to k.
3. **When k cames to joke with q in front of me,q didn't go away,but joke with k happliy.**
4. **Q can joke with k when she using the keyboard I gifted as her birthday present.**
5. **Observation 3,4 always discovered by me,Indicating that they do not have randomness.**
6. Observation 3,4 said that the balance of her psychological weight has tilted towards k.

**Lemma**:

1. For normal people, it is more important to consider the feelings of friends than those of enemies.
2. For normal people, accepting a gift from a friend means accepting the responsibility as a friend.
3. For normal people, as friends, it is their responsibility not to make them feel uncomfortable.
But,the observation 1,2,3 said that my priority is lower than his,this contradicts Lemma 1.
And,the observation 1,4 said she can make me sad without changing her expression,this contracdicts Lemma 2,3.

This contradicts our assumption that values with ZhengHao are sound.

$Q.E.D$

**Corollary**: Therefore, ZhengHao's values are not only problematic but also **non-normal**.

**Conclusion:** The soundness of values with ZhengHao has been disproven. Handling such values may lead to undefined behavior and emotional segmentation faults.

**Suggestion**: Execute `sudo rm -rf /social/path/to/ZhengHao` and perform a thorough friendship garbage collection.
